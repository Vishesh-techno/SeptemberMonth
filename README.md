## 💡 About My Daily Coding Practice

I code every day with dedication and focus on solving **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems, mainly on **LeetCode**. This daily habit has helped me:

- 🧠 Understand common **DSA patterns** like sliding window, two pointers, recursion, and more.
- 🔍 Improve my **logic-building** and **problem-solving** skills by solving real interview-style questions.
- 📁 Maintain a well-organized **GitHub repository** where I regularly upload my solutions with clean and readable code.
- 🛠️ Work on consistency, discipline, and technical growth — all of which are crucial for a strong software development career.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

I'm **job-ready** and confident in my ability to take on technical roles that require DSA proficiency and logical thinking.  
My consistent effort demonstrates my:

- ✅ Passion for coding
- ✅ Commitment to improvement
- ✅ Ability to learn and adapt
- ✅ Readiness to work in a fast-paced professional environment
